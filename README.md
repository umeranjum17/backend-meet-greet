# backend-meet-greet

I wrote the backend of the project with node, typescript and express. The choice of the project structure was made keeping in mind the abstraction and independence from the backend framework being used. Along with that the project structure was made to foresee the addition of microservice pattern in mind combined together with domain driven clean architecture.
I have kept each module separate along with that all the technical files of that module are added into that particular directory. 
ESlint and prettier are used to enforce coding standards so that all the team who would be working on such a code base can adhere to a common pattern.

Another Good choice of more opinionated technology for Javascript server would be NEST.js which enforces these restrictions.

Use Yarn dev:start to run the application
